About Me
I'm Ryan Susilo, a data science and product enthusiast with a passion for using data to gain insights and deliver business value. 
I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Applied Analytics at Columbia University and I'm seeking data and product internships for the summer of 2025.
My particular interests lie in product analytics, where I can work on data science tasks while staying close to the business side!
